# Possible Options:
#   -ol = Overall effort level. high is maximum effort.
#         Default: std (standard)
#   -pl = Placer effort level. high is maximum effort. Overrides
#         any placer effort level implied by "-ol" option.
#         Default: std (standard)
#   -rl = Router effort level. high is maximum effort. Overrides
#         any router effort level implied by "-ol" option.
#         Default: std (standard)
#   -xe = Extra effort level. c (Continue on Impossible) is maximum effort.
#         Default: none
#   -t =  Placer cost table entry. Start at this entry.
#         Default: 1.
#   -p =  Don't run the placer. (Keep current placement)
#   -k =  Re-entrant route. Keep the current placement. Continue the routing
#         using the existing routing as a starting point.
#   -r =  Don't run the router.
#   -w =  Overwrite. Allows overwrite of an existing file (including input
#         file). If specified output is a directory, allows files in
#         directory to be overwritten.
#   -f =  Read par command line arguments and switches from file.
#   -smartguide = Enables SmartGuide using guidefile.ncd as the guide file. 
#   -n =  P&R Iterations at this level. Use "-n 0" to run until a
#         successful result is generated. The result must be fully
#         routed and meet timing constraints. The output file must
#         have a ".dir" extension for -n option != 1.
#         Default: 1.
#   -s =  Save "n" best results for this run. Best is defined by the
#         design score which is a combination of unroutes, net delay,
#         and failed timing values.
#         Default: Save all results.
#   -m =  Multi task par run. File <node list file> ",
#         contains a list of node names on which to run the jobs.
#         (This option is available for supported SOLARIS and LINUX operating
#          systems only).
#   -x =  Ignore user timing constraints in physical constraints file and 
#         generate timing constraints automatically for all internal clocks to 
#         increase performance. Note: the level of performance achieved will 
#         be dictated by the effort level (-ol std|med|high) chosen.
#   -ub = Use bonded IOs. Allow bonded IO sites to be used for internal
#         logic. This includes IOs which do not require the pad as well
#         as allowing the router to route through the IO site.
#   -nopad = Turns off generation of the pad report.
#         Default: Pad Report Generated
#   -power = Power Aware Par.  Optimizes the capacitance of non-timing-driven
#            design signals.
#         Default: off
#   -activityfile <activityfile.vcd|saif> = Switching activity data file to 
#            guide power optimization.  This option is only valid if the 
#            "-power on" option has been used. 
#   -intstyle = Indicate contextual information when invoking Xilinx applications 
#         within a flow or project environment.
#         The mode "xflow" indicates that the program is being run as part of a 
#         batch flow. The mode "silent" indicates that no output will be 
#         displayed to the screen. The mode "ise" indicates that the program is being
#         run as part of an integrated design environment. 
#         Default: Program is run as a standalone application.
#   -ise = Use supplied ISE project repository file.
#   -ntd = Ignore Timing constraints in physical constraints file and do NOT
#         generate timing constraints automatically.
