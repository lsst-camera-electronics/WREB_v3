# Possible Options For Virtex4:
#   -bp               Map slice logic into unused block RAMs.
#   -c <packfactor>   Pack unrelated logic into clbs.  <packfactor> indicates
#                       what % of CLB resource to target.  Range: 0 <= 
#                       <packfactor> <= 100 (default is 100).
#   -cm area|speed|balanced
#                     Cover mode.  Default is "area".  Synthesis based designs 
#                       are not likely to see improvement by changing the 
#                       default.
#   -detail           Print a more verbose map report. 
#   -equivalent_register_removal on|off
#                     Remove redundant registers during global optimization
#                       (default is on).
#   -f <cmdfile>      Read command line arguments from file <cmdfile>.
#   -global_opt off|speed
#                     Perform global optimization before mapping
#                       (default is off).
#   -ignore_keep_hierarchy
#                     Ignore any KEEP_HIERARCHY properties attached to blocks
#   -intstyle ise|xflow|silent
#                     Reduce the screen output.
#   -ir [off|place|all]
#                     Do not use RLOC constraints to generate RPMs.
#                     Default is "off". Use RLOCs to group logic together
#                     within a CLB, but not to control the relative placement
#                     of CLBs with respect to each other.
#   -ise <iseProjectFile>
#                     Use supplied ISE project file.
#   -l                Disable logic replication.
#   -logic_opt off|on Perform physical synthesis combinatorial logic
#                       optimizations during timing driven packing
#                       (default is off).
#   -ntd              Perform non-timing driven placement when used with -timing.
#   -o                Specify the output file name.
#   -ol std|high      Effort level.
#   -p <partname>     Map to part <partname>.
#   -power off|on     Power optimizations.
#   -activityfile <activityfile.vcd|.saif> 
#                     Switching activity data file to guide power optimizations
#   -pr off|i|o|b     Pack internal flops/latches into input IOBs (i),
#                       output IOBs (o), both types of IOBs, or internal
#                       fabric such as slices, BRAMs, or DSP blocks (off).
#                       Default is off.
#   -register_duplication [off|on]
#                     Duplicate registers/luts during timing-driven packing 
#                     in order to improve timing(default is off).
#   -retiming off|on  Run register retiming during global optimization
#                       (default is off).
#   -smartguide <guidefile>
#                     Enables SmartGuide using guidefile.ncd as the guide file.
#                       guidefile.ncd must be a placed and routed ncd.
#   -t <costtable>    Timing-driven cost table entry.  Range:  1 <= <costtable> 
#                       <= 100 (default is 1).
#   -timing           Perform a timing-driven packing.
#   -u                Do not remove unnecessary/disabled logic.
#   -x                Enable Performance Evaluation Mode. In this mode, the 
#                     tools will ignore any timing constraints specified in
#                     a constraints file and auto-generate timing constraints 
#                     to drive tool performance.
#   -xe c|n           Extra effort level for timing-driven packing.  'c' means
#                       continue to improve timing even if timing constraints
#                       cannot be met.  'n' means try additional algorithms to 
#                       meet timing.
